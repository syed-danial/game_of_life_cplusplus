C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton simulating cell evolution based on simple rules. Visualize intriguing patterns.
The Game of Life is not only a fascinating example of emergent behavior in a simple system but also a classic programming exercise that challenges your understanding of algorithms, data structures, and visualization techniques. By implementing it in C++, I have gained valuable insights into managing data structures efficiently, handling user input, and creating interactive console-based applications.

This project serves as an educational and entertaining way to explore the world of cellular automata, and it provides a solid foundation for further enhancements, such as adding graphical user interfaces or optimizing the performance of the simulation.
